# How to Clear Filter Values in a Dashboard State 

This example shows how to clear/select all filter values in a Dashboard state.

![](/image.png)

When the application starts, the **DashboardDesigner** loads a dashboard and a [DashboardState](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardState) object.

- [Neutral filter mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400262/common-features/interactivity/neutral-filter-mode?p=netframework) is enabled (**UseNeutralFilterMode == true**):

  Pass an empty **MasterFilterValues** object of a dashboard item to the entire dashboard state to clear filters (unselect all values).

- [Neutral filter mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400262/common-features/interactivity/neutral-filter-mode?p=netframework) is disabled (**UseNeutralFilterMode == false**):

  Assign _null_ to the **MasterFilterValues** object of a filter element and pass it to the entire dashboard state to select all values.
  
The [DashboardDesigner.SetDashboardState](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.SetDashboardState(DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardState)?p=netframework) method applies the created dashboard state at runtime. 

You can click the **Reset Dashboard State** button to apply the dashboard state at runtime.

When neutral filter mode is disabled, there is a difference between _null_ and _empty_ master filter values:

|MasterFilterValues values|Behavior|
|----|----|
| MasterFilterValues = null | The control filters data by all values (all values are selected). |
| MasterFilterValues = [] | The control excludes all filter (no data is selected). |
